# The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena Notes

* This is a compilation of my notes while reading Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena.

## Chapter 1 - Introduction to Algorithm Design

* There are three desirable properties for a good algorithm. We seek algorithms
that are correct and efficient, while being easy to implement.

* Correct algorithms usually come with
a proof of correctness, which is an explanation of why we know that the algorithm
must take every instance of the problem to the desired result. However, before we go
further we demonstrate why “it’s obvious” never suffices as a proof of correctness,
and is usually flat-out wrong.
